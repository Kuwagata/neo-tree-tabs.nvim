# neo-tree-tabs.nvim

Although I often use telescope to switch buffers, I find it less convenient for switching between tabs, which I use to provide a variety of views for a project. I also like the idea of naming my views, so I can, for example, label a tab containing a few open configuration files as "config".

I'd like to add a few features eventually:

- Saving / loading predefined views
- Optionally separate buffers from windows, so they can be scoped to a tab or window and remain in the list so long as they are still loaded

After using this for a while I'd like to make a similar extension that would serve as a project management solution.
